# Stage 1: Build Stage
# Use an official Node.js image as a base
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production Stage
# Use a smaller Node.js runtime image to reduce the image size
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the necessary files from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
